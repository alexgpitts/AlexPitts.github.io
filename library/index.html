    <h1>This is a cool background!!!</h1>
    
    <p>I used a library called granim.js to make a multi gradient background.</p>
    <p>There must be an easier way to use the library than putting functions in the original code?</p>
    <p>Also, I cant seem to figure out why it covers all my text when I set it to full screen.</p>
    <p>I already tried to set the z-index for them and that changes nothing</p>
    <canvas id="canvas-basic"></canvas>

    <script src="libraries/granim.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
