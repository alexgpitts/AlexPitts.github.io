    <h2>How I started playing</h2>

    <P>
        When I was really little, my mom inherited a piano from my her aunt. 
        My mom took piano lessons when she was little and decided she would 
        teach me how to play.
    </P>

    <P>
        I learned some basic songs like Silent Night 
        and Chopsticks. After a while I lost interest and My parents had 
        gotten rid of the piano because we had to move. I didn’t play an 
        instrument again until I was in the 4th grade and signed up for 
        band class. I played the trombone until I was in the 7th grade and 
        over those years I learned how to read sheet music.

        I didn’t play again after that until I was 17, when my parent got their piano back 
        the same piano I had played on as a kid. I Liked playing so much that 
        I bought my own digital piano for my room. This is also around the same time 
        my brother in law got my into playing guitar. I have been playing instruments non stop
        ever since.
